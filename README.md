# 2001 - ACIE 10th Anniversary website
American Councils for International Exchange 10th Anniversary website created in 2001 and maintained throughout 2002: https://simplebeat.github.io/2001-FLEX/index.html

Created in August 2001 this web-site was one of the very first web projects I've worked on in my web developer career. It was a very exciting new field to explore, and I liked the idea of creating and putting the entire website online all by myself. I've used HTML4.0, CSS1, and a simple third-party page visit counter integration.

The source code you see here is almost the original, with just a few minor adjustments to css and slight formatting tweaks it is still showing up perfectly fine in all modern browsers, including on mobile devices.
