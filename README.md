# 2001-FLEX
2001 Volgograd FSA (Freedom Support Act) program web-site.

Created in August 2001 this web-site was one of the very first web projects I've worked on in my web developer career. It was a very exciting new field to explore, and I liked the idea of creating and putting the entire website online all by myself. 

The source code you see here is almost the original, with just a slight adjustments to css and minor formatting tweaks it is still showing up perfectly fine in all modern browsers.
